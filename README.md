<h4>Random</h4>
The Python import random module in Python defines a series of functions for generating or manipulating random integers. Python random() is a pseudo-random number generator function that generates a random float number between 0.0 and 1.0, is used by functions in the random module.

<h4>String</h4>
Strings can be used to handle textual data in Python. Python Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode points. Creating Strings is the simplest and easy to use in Python. To create a string in Python, we simply enclose a text in single as well as double-quotes.
